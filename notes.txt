Just comments about certain things I notice.

#1: I believe the conversion table program the book provided is incorrect? I noticed this when I did the celsius to fahrenheit exercise.
#2: Disregard #1, I was just thinking about it incorrectly. It is infact, correct.
#3: Started naming my exercises with a chapter_exercise format as is presented in the book. Examples will still be named pretty intuitively.
