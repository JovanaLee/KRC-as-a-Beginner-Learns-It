# KRC-as-a-Beginner-Learns-It

Hi! I'm Jovana, and I'm a hobbyist programmer, and relatively new to the programming scene.
I have a decent amount of experience with some of the fundementals, but I never really got
good at anything in particular.

So I decided the proper starting point was here! With "The C Programming Language (Second Edition)" book.

This repo is mostly as an archival for ME, but anybody is free to look over my solutions to
try and understand my decision making, and maybe apply it to their own solutions.

I have an unlicense on this thing, so feel free to do whatever you want with this code!
