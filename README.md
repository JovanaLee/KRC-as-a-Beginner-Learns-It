# KRC-as-a-Beginner-Learns-It

Hi! I'm Jovana, and I'm a hobbyist programmer, and relatively new to the programming scene.
I have a decent amount of experience with some of the fundementals, but I never really got
good at anything in particular.

So I decided the proper starting point was here! With "The C Programming Language (Second Edition)" book.

This repo is mostly as an archival for ME, but anybody is free to look over my solutions to
try and understand my decision making, and maybe apply it to their own solutions.

I have an unlicense on this thing, so feel free to do whatever you want with this code!

BY THE WAY: This was all done on a Debian 12 VM. So the builds are specific to that OS.
I'm really not quite sure on like how cross platfrom .out(s) work so you may or may not
have to recompile any file you want to see produce an example.

All programs have been somewhat thoroughly bugtested (atleast, the experimental and exercise programs,
I'm not testing the examples.) so you won't have to worry about changing anything.
